    <ProductSection name="Galois" description="Decentralized proving for everyone. Galois, a key component of Union's ZK efforts, ensures proof verification with lightning-fast execution, cost-efficient operation, and decentralized infrastructure." link="/docs/architecture/galois" model={microGaloisModel}/>
    <ProductSection name="CometBLS" description="ZK-aligned consensus engine. CometBLS is an enhancement upon Tendermint which utilizes BLS signatures for efficient ZK proving, and thereby ensuring secure bridging and consensus verification." link="/docs/architecture/cometbls" model={microCometblsModel}/>
    <ProductSection name="Voyager" description="Stateless relaying for a cross-chain future. Voyager is our in-house relayer, allowing us to support new networks without waiting for up-stream support, by seamlessly integrating with Galois." link="/docs/architecture/voyager" model={microVoyagerModel}/>
