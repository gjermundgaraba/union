Welcome to the Union Testnet! This guide will instruct you on running a node and creating a validator for `union-testnet-8`.

## Steps

These are the general steps for running a node and creating a validator for the Union testnet.

### Acquiring a Machine

You may run the Union node on your own machine or a VPS, please ensure your machine or VPS meets our [node operator requirements](/infrastructure/node-operators/requirements/).

### Running the Client Binary

To begin - you first need to obtain and run the client binary, `uniond`.

Officially, **we only support running the binary as a Docker container**. You're free to extract and run the binary manually, but we won't be providing first class support for issues running `uniond` outside of the Docker images we provide.

We offer two Docker images that are capable of running the client binary.

#### Unionvisor

Unionvisor is a utility for managing `uniond` deployments. It manages running, upgrading, and interacting with the node. Read our guide for [Running Unionvisor](/joining-testnet/unionvisor/) to learn more.

#### uniond-release

For more manual control, we also release each version of `uniond` as a Docker image. You can learn more in our [Running the Client Binary](/joining-testnet/obtaining-uniond/) guide.

### Getting Testnet Tokens

For validators who were chosen to be in the initial set of 64 validators, please see our [Getting Testnet Tokens](/joining-testnet/getting-tokens/) guide.

For others seeking to become validators, please stay tuned for more information. The best place to get the most recent information is [our Discord](https://discord.union.build).

:::note

The faucet linked to the Union Testnet token transfer demo is not intended as a source of tokens for validators. The faucet exists only to allow users to experiment with the demo.

### Creating a Validator

Once you have the tokens required to create a validator and have synced your node, you can follow our [Creating a Validator](/joining-testnet/creating-validators/) guide to complete your onboarding.
