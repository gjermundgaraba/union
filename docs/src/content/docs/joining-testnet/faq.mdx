As we continue onboarding validators and expanding the testnet, we'll populate this page with FAQs in regard to becoming a validator on the Union Testnet.

### How can I become a validator?

We started our testnet with the goal of onboarding 64 validators. The sign-up form for these first 64 slots has been closed.

We have now expanded the Union testnet to support 128 validators. Those interested can submit their Union address to the Subo Survey Bot on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/union-build) to have a chance of being selected as a validator and receiving tokens from the Union team. The Subo "Union Testnet Validator Intake Form" closed on February 19th, 2024.

### Why can't I submit transactions to `localhost` when using `docker run`?

Ensure you have exposed your host machine's network via the `--network` flag in docker.

### My query commands aren't using values from my client config?

Due to [an issue in the cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/18868), commands using AutoCLI do not respect the `--home` flag and instead always try and read the default home. As a temporary fix, we've removed the behavior reading the default home, always require a `--home` flag, and moved all `tx` commands away from AutoCLI. However, `query` commands still use AutoCLI and won't read the `--home` flag.

To get around this behavior, we suggest always supplying `--node` and `--chain-id` when using query commands.

### Can I have access to the Union GitHub repository?

We are not currently providing the general public access to our GitHub repositories.
