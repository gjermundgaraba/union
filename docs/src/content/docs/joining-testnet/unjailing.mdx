For whatever reason your validator becomes jailed while partaking in the Union network, you can unjail your validator with a simple command.

## The Unjail command

Once your validator is unbonded and jailed, you can use the unjail command to rejoin the active set.

The unjail command is a transaction command from the slashing module and can be submitted like this:

```sh
uniond tx slashing unjail --from $KEY_NAME
```

## Epoch Staking & Validator Set Updates

Just like [creating your validator](/joining-testnet/creating-validators/#epoch-staking--validator-set-updates), once you've unjailed your validator, they'll rejoin the active set at the end of the current epoch.
