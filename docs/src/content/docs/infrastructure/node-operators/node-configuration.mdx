After successfully running your node with `uniond`, you can refer to this guide to aid you in configuring your node.

This is not a complete guide to all node configuration options, this is intended to help ensure that your node is fully operational.

This guide will assume that you're starting at the root of your Union node configuration (located at `~/.union/` by default or `~/.unionvisor/home` if you're using Unionvisor).

## Client Configuration

Located in `config/client.toml`, this file is host to client settings.

### The Network Chain ID

Update this value to ensure that your client is supplied with the correct chain ID.

For the Union Testnet, this value should be `"union-testnet-8"`.

```toml
# The network chain ID
chain-id = "union-testnet-8"
```

### Host/Port for the Tendermint RPC

This will determine which address your client will listen for Tendermint RPC request on.

This will default to `"tcp://localhost:26657"`, setting this to `"tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"` will ensure it's listening on every available network interface.

```toml
# <host>:<port> to Tendermint RPC interface for this chain
node = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"
```

## App Configuration

Located in `config/app.toml`, this file is host to app settings.

### Minimum Gas Price

Located under the "Base Configuration" section of `config/app.toml`.

While optional, you may wish to ensure your node receives a minimum fee when processing transactions. Whatever you choose for this value, ensure it uses the correct denom. For the Union Testnet, the correct denom is `muno`.

```toml
# The minimum gas prices a validator is willing to accept for processing a
# transaction. A transaction's fees must meet the minimum of any denomination
# specified in this config (e.g. 0.25token1;0.0001token2).
minimum-gas-prices = "0muno"
```

### Pruning

Located under the "Base Configuration" section of `config/app.toml`.

Several options are available here, ensure you've selected the one that best fits your nodes storage capabilities.

```toml
# default: the last 362880 states are kept, pruning at 10 block intervals
# nothing: all historic states will be saved, nothing will be deleted (i.e. archiving node)
# everything: 2 latest states will be kept; pruning at 10 block intervals.
# custom: allow pruning options to be manually specified through 'pruning-keep-recent', and 'pruning-interval'
pruning = "default"
```

## Node Configuration

Located in `config/config.toml`, this file is host to many settings.

### Consensus

To achieve a low target block time, the Union team asks validators to make the following changes to their configuration.

Located in the `consensus` TOML table under the "Consensus Configuration Options" section.

```toml
# How long we wait for a proposal block before pre-voting nil
timeout_propose = "3s"
# How much timeout_propose increases with each round
timeout_propose_delta = "500ms"
# How long we wait after receiving +2/3 prevotes for “anything” (ie. not a single block or nil)
timeout_prevote = "1s"
# How much the timeout_prevote increases with each round
timeout_prevote_delta = "500ms"
# How long we wait after receiving +2/3 precommits for “anything” (ie. not a single block or nil)
timeout_precommit = "1s"
# How much the timeout_precommit increases with each round
timeout_precommit_delta = "500ms"
# How long we wait after committing a block, before starting on the new
# height (this gives us a chance to receive some more precommits, even
# though we already have +2/3).
timeout_commit = "1s"  
```

### RPC Listening Address

Located in the `rpc` TOML table under the "RPC Server Configuration Options" section.

You'll want to ensure your node is configured to accept rpc connections. To do so, set this value to the appropriate address.

For example, to listen on every available network interface - set this to `"tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"`.

```toml
# TCP or UNIX socket address for the RPC server to listen on
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657"
```

### P2P Listening Address

Located in the `p2p` TOML table under the "P2P Configuration Options" section.

You'll want to ensure your node is configured to accept p2p connections. To do so, set this value to the appropriate address.

For example, to listen on every available network interface - set this to `"tcp://0.0.0.0:26656"`.

```toml
# Address to listen for incoming connections
laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:26656"
```

### External Address

Located in the `p2p` TOML table under the "P2P Configuration Options" section.

If you've configured a domain name for your node, this is the place to inform your node of it.

```toml
# Address to advertise to peers for them to dial
# If empty, will use the same port as the laddr,
# and will introspect on the listener or use UPnP
# to figure out the address. ip and port are required
# example: 159.89.10.97:26656
external_address = "example.com:26656"
```

### Seeds

Located in the `p2p` TOML table under the "P2P Configuration Options" section.

Seed nodes help orchestrate initial connections to the network. For union-testnet-8, the seed nodes are:

<Code
  lang='toml'
  code={`seeds = "${chainVersion({ chainId: 'union-testnet-8' }).seeds}"`} 
/>


### Seed Mode

Located in the `p2p` TOML table under the "P2P Configuration Options" section.

If you'd like to be a seed node, be sure to set this to `true`.

:::caution

If you plan for your node to be a validator, it should not also be a seed node.

:::

```toml
# Seed mode, in which node constantly crawls the network and looks for
# peers. If another node asks it for addresses, it responds and disconnects.
#
# Does not work if the peer-exchange reactor is disabled.
seed_mode = false
```
