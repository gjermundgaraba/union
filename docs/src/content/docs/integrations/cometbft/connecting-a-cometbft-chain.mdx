Opening a connection from CometBFT-based chains is simple. In general it requires three main steps:

1. Ensure you are on a recent Cosmos SDK version, and support wasm light clients.
2. Upload the Union wasm light client.
3. Open a connection and channel.

You can execute this from a local devnet, testnet, and production network to connect to Union's testnet and start receiving funds. When
connecting a local devnet, you will need to keep it running to ensure the connection and channel stay alive.
